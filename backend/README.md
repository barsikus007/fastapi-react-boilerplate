## Install python
#### On Windows
I recommend [scoop](scoop.sh) package manager
```pwsh
scoop install python
```
#### On Linux
You already have python, just be sure that you have 3.10 version installed (But you may need venv package. Install it via `sudo apt install python3-venv -y` on Ububntu)
If your version is lower then find the way to install it on your disto
Here is most common distro installation instruction:
##### On Ubuntu
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
sudo apt install python3.10-venv -y
```
## Install packages
Be sure that you in backend dir
#### On Windows
```pwsh
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip
venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### On Linux
```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
